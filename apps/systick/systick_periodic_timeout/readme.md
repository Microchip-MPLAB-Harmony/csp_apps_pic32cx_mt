# Systick periodic interrupt

This example shows how to use the SysTick to generate periodic interrupts.

## Description

This example application configures the SysTick Peripheral Library to generate periodic ticks. The application registers a periodic timeout callback. It toggles an LED every time the callback is triggered.
