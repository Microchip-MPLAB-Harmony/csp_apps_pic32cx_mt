# ADC Polling

This example demonstrates how to sample an analog input in polled mode and send the converted data to console.

## Description

In this example, Analog input voltage in the range of 0 V to 3.3 V is fed to the ADC and converted value is displayed on the console. The ADC conversion is triggered by software and result is polled using status API.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32cx_mt) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

### Setting up [PIC32CXMTSH Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/PIC32CXMTSH-DB)

- AD1 pin is used for analog input
- Use a jumper wire to connect Pin 3 of Xplained PRO Header (AD1 is mapped to Port Pin PA30) to 3.3 V or GND
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. console displays the ADC Count and the ADC Input Voltage
